# Stock Alert


Stock Alert is a web app I built for my CS 361 Software Engineering course at Oregon State University. 
The purpose is to allow users to set up automated alerts to notify them when their stocks hit a given price target.
This code runs on the Oreogn State Engineering servers and utilizes my [user login/authentication microservice](https://github.com/PatrickArntson/CS361_microservice), 
as well as one of my classmate's web-scraping microservice.


Since the website currently lives on the Oregon State Engineering servers, here is a [video demonstration of the website](https://youtu.be/nr_OebMfb-Y).
