# Stock Alert


Stock Alert is a web app I built for my CS 361 Software Engineering course at Oregon State University. 
The purpose is to allow users to set up automated alerts to notify them when their stocks hit a given price target.
This code runs on the Oreogn State Engineering servers and uses one of my classmates web-scraping microservice.
