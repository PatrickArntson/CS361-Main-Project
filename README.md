# Stock Alert


Stock Alert is a web app I built for my CS 361 Software Engineering course at Oregon State University. 
The purpose is to allow users to set up automated alerts to notify them when their stocks hit a given price target.
This code runs on the Oreogn State Engineering servers and utilizes my (user login/authentication microservice)[https://github.com/PatrickArntson/CS361_microservice], 
as well as one of my classmate's web-scraping microservice.
